/**
 * The goal of this problem is to write an algorithm that will calculate the square root of a given
 * {@code long} a.  A square root for a number 'x' is defined as another number 'y' such that when y
 * is multiplied by itself it is equal to x (i.e. x = y * y).
 *
 * If a square root of the given {@code long} a has a value which is a whole number, then it should
 * be returned, otherwise -1 should be returned.
 *
 * Only positive values will be provided as the value of a.
 *
 * A correct solution to this problem should be done without using the standard Java {@link Math}
 * library, any standard Java library that would be capable of calculating either of the values, or
 * any other third party library.  A good solution to this problem should run in better than O(n)
 * time.
